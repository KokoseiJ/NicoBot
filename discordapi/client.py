        Sends a request to API.

        Args:
            endpoint:
                An endpoint to send a request to.
                It shouldn't have a `/` in front of it. otherwise It would
                replace the entire URL path, resulting in an error.
            data:
                A data to be sent. It could be either None, dict, str or any
                other formats that urllib.request.Request accepts.
            method:
                A method to be used while sending a request.
                Default value is "GET", if data is not specified. if data has
                been specified, It gets set to "POST". to override this, you'll
                have to specify the method you'd like to use when calling the
                function.
            content_type:
                A content_type to be sent.
                Default value is "application/json" if the type of `data` is
                `dict`. else, It gets set to "text/plain." You can specify the
                value you'd like to use to override this, too.
            headers:
                Headers to be sent if you need to specify additional headers.
                Beware that "Content-Type", and other values specified in
                `self.headers` will be overrided.

        Returns:
            a tuple with a format of `(data, status, res)`, where `data` is
            `dict`, `status` is `int` and `res` is either `HTTPResponse` or
            `HTTPError` object depending on what was the status code.
